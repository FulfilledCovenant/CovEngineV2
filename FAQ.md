## Questions and Answers

**Q - Is this safe?**

**A** Yes, the source code is public. For anyone to view.

**Q - I don't know what tweaks to use.**

**A** If you do not know where to start, join our discord server for suggestions. You can also use tweaks in the gaming tab, under tweaks section. These are generally the least conflicting.

**Q - Will the spoof feature get me banned?**

**A** The spoof feature (HWID), is meant to randomize system serials to evade previous bans. Currently, it is not possible for roblox to detect the spoofing mechanisms, as they utilize system attributes to change serials. Thus, roblox would need to have the same permissions to detect these kinds of changes.

**Q - What are the best settings?**

**A** There are no best settings. Each computer is different, and thus the "best" settings for you may be different for any other user.
